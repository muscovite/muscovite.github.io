### Video Games - Multi Player

- Castle Crashers
- Children of Morta
- Gloomhaven
    - board game port; works much better in digital form IMO
    - more fun playing "local" co-op!
- Gloomhaven/Frosthaven in Tabletop Simulator
- Overcooked series
- Portal 2
- Untitled Goose Game
- Wizard of Legend
- Baldur's Gate 3
    - I suppose it's single player as well, but I have no experience with that
