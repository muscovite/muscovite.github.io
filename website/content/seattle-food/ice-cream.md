## Decent
- [Bluebird](https://bluebirdicecream.square.site/)
- [Cupcake Royale](https://www.cupcakeroyale.com/)
- [Milk Drunk](https://www.themilkdrunk.com/)
    - Soft serve
- [Indigo Cow](https://www.instagram.com/indigo_cow/)
    - Tastes like it's made of good quality fresh milk, but there's not much flavor
    - Highlight was actually the Theo chocolate hard shell

## Not recommended
- Salt & Straw
    - Interesting sounding flavors rarely live up to expectations
- Full Tilt
    - Thai Tea and Ube are decent sometimes
- Fainting Goat
    - Weird because they are basically the same store as Nutty Squirrel (owned by either parents/children of FG's owners)
- Shug's
- YoYo and CoCo
