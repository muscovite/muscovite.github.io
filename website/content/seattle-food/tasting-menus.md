## Recommended
## Tier 1
- [Taneda Sushi in Kaiseki](https://tanedaseattle.com/)
    - Very hard to get reservations! Best bet is to sign up for cancellation notifications, or stalk their page at midnight for a spot 60 days out
- [Sushi Kashiba](https://sushikashiba.com/)
- [Altura](https://alturarestaurant.com/)

## Tier 2
- [Copine](https://www.copineseattle.com/)
- [Eight Row](https://www.eightrow.com/)
- [Carrello](https://www.carrellorestaurant.com/)
    - Altura's younger sibling, just as solid at a lower price point
- [Cook Weaver](https://www.cookweaver.com/)
- [Archipelago](https://www.archipelagoseattle.com/)
- [Cafe Juanita](https://www.cafejuanita.com/)
    - Four tasting menus (omnivore, pescatarian, vegetarian, and vegan) and you're allowed to mix and match components of each
- [The Herbfarm](https://www.theherbfarm.com/)
- [Surrell](https://surrellseattle.com/)
    - They are very slow. Expect a 2.5-3 hr long meal
- _[The Shambles](https://www.delimeatsbar.com/) (no longer offered)_

## Tier 3
- [Canlis](https://canlis.com/)
    - mostly for the views and to see if new executive chef is doing anything interesting
- [Ltd Edition Sushi](https://www.ltdeditionsushi.com/)
    - solely fish focused (unlike, e.g. Taneda)
    - generous sushi sizes
    - flavor mixes a little hit or miss
- [Sushi by Scratch](https://www.sushibyscratchrestaurants.com/)
    - Very fusion, but keeps the flavors subtle so they work pretty well
    - Vibe is too modern for our liking
- [Sushi Suzuki](https://www.sushisuzuki.com/about)
- [TOMO](https://tomoseattle.com/)
    - Portions are on the smaller side

## Tier 4
- [Takai by Kashiba](https://takaibykashiba.com/)
    - The "free" parking situation really brings this low. They pair with some commerical building whose time limit isn't even long enough for the omakase and who tickets you literally a minute past your time window 
- [Sushi Kappo Tamura](https://www.sushikappotamura.com/)

## Decent
- [Eden Hill](https://www.edenhillrestaurant.com/)
- [Wataru](https://wataruseattle.com/)
- [SAI Sushi & Sake](https://www.saisushiandsake.com/)
- [Haymaker](https://www.haymakerseattle.com/)
- [Corson Building](https://www.thecorsonbuilding.com/)
- [Wa'z](https://www.wazseattle.com/)
- [Violet](https://www.violetseattle.com/)
