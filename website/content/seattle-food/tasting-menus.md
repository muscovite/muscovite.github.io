## Recommended
### Tier 1
- [Taneda Sushi in Kaiseki](https://tanedaseattle.com/)
    - Very hard to get reservations! Best bet is to sign up for cancellation notifications, or stalk their page at midnight for a spot 60 days out
- [Sushi Kashiba](https://sushikashiba.com/)
- [Altura](https://alturarestaurant.com/)

## Tier 2
- [Canlis](https://canlis.com/)
    - mostly for the views and to see if new executive chef is doing anything interesting
- [Eight Row](https://www.eightrow.com/)
- [Archipelago](https://www.archipelagoseattle.com/)
- _[The Shambles](https://www.delimeatsbar.com/) (no longer offered)_
- [Ltd Edition Sushi](https://www.ltdeditionsushi.com/)
    - solely fish focused (unlike, e.g. Taneda)
    - generous sushi sizes
    - flavor mixes a little hit or miss
